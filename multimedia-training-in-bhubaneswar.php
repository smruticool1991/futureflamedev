            <p>In 2015, the Film Industry grew by 9.3 per cent to reach INR 138.2 billion and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.5% to reach INR 227.3 by 2020. There was a substantial growth in regional and Hollywood film collections. Regional films which are normally the mainstay of single screens, contributed up to 30 per cent in revenues at some national multiplexes. The enormous success of Baahubali : The Beginning, a Telegu film, showed that good content can break language barriers and achieve mainstream success. Another significant trend is the shift in audience preferences to content-driven rather than merely star driven films. According to FICCI-KPMG, digital content is expected to emerge as an independent revenue stream. In the coming years, the share of digital revenues is expected to grow significantly (upwards of 30 per cent).</p>
